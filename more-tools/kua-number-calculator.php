            <h2>What is My Kua Number?</h2>
            <p>If you're asking, "<strong>what is my kua number?</strong>", you're tapping into a core principle of Feng Shui. Your <strong>personal Kua number</strong> (also known as a Ming Gua) is a single digit from 1 to 9 that reveals your personal energy blueprint. It's calculated from your birth year and gender and is used to determine your lucky and unlucky directions. Our <strong>Feng Shui Kua Number Calculator</strong> makes it easy to find your number instantly.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>How to Calculate Kua Number</h2>
            <p>Learning <strong>how to calculate Kua number</strong> is straightforward. For example, to find the <strong>kua number for a male born in 1984</strong>: add the last two digits (8 + 4 = 12), reduce to a single digit (1 + 2 = 3), and subtract from 10 (10 - 3 = 7). His Kua number is 7. The formula for <strong>how to calculate kua number for female</strong> is slightly different. Our calculator automates this process for any year.</p>
            <hr>

            <p>Each <strong>Kua number meaning</strong> is associated with a specific element, direction, and set of characteristics.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kua Number 1:</strong> (Water Element, North) Represents independence and communication. East Group.</li>
                <li><strong>Kua Number 2:</strong> (Earth Element, Southwest) Symbolizes harmony, relationships, and care. West Group.</li>
                <li><strong>Kua Number 3:</strong> (Wood Element, East) Signifies growth, family, and ambition. East Group.</li>
                <li><strong>Kua Number 4:</strong> (Wood Element, Southeast) Represents creativity, wealth, and gentle progress. East Group.</li>
                <li><strong>Kua Number 6:</strong> (Metal Element, Northwest) Symbolizes leadership, discipline, and heavenly support. West Group.</li>
                <li><strong>Kua Number 7:</strong> (Metal Element, West) Represents joy, creativity, and social connections. West Group.</li>
                <li><strong>Kua Number 8:</strong> (Earth Element, Northeast) Signifies knowledge, stability, and self-improvement. West Group.</li>
                <li><strong>Kua Number 9:</strong> (Fire Element, South) Represents fame, passion, and recognition. East Group.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr>
            <h2>Kua Number Compatibility</h2>
            <p><strong>Kua number compatibility</strong> is an important aspect of Feng Shui for relationships. Generally, people from the same group (East or West) are more compatible. An East Group person (Kua 1, 3, 4, 9) will harmonize well with another East Group person. A West Group person (Kua 2, 6, 7, 8) is best matched with another West Group person. While this is not a standalone <strong>kua number compatibility calculator</strong>, knowing your groups provides a great starting point for assessing relationship dynamics.</p>

                    In Feng Shui, the Kua number 5 does not exist. If a male's calculation results in 5, their Kua number becomes 2. If a female's calculation results in 5, their Kua number becomes 8. This ensures everyone falls into one of the eight valid Kua numbers.

                    No, your Kua number is fixed for life, as it's based on your birth year and gender. It's a constant aspect of your <strong>personal energy</strong> in Feng Shui.

                    No, they are from different numerology systems. The <strong>Kua number</strong> is from Feng Shui and is based on your birth year and gender. The Driver and Conductor numbers are from <strong>Lo Shu Grid</strong> numerology and are calculated from your full date of birth.
